Description: An implementation of the adaptive forgetting factor scheme described in Bodenham and Adams (2016) <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9684-8> which adaptively estimates the mean and variance of a stream in order to detect multiple changepoints in streaming data. The implementation is in 'C++' and uses 'Rcpp'. Additionally, implementations of the fixed forgetting factor scheme from the same paper, as well as the classic cumulative sum ('CUSUM') and exponentially weighted moving average ('EWMA') methods, are included.
